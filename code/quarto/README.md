# Case-studies

Here we provide Quarto documents with more detailed case-studies of the examples presented in the main article. Grouped by the sections of the article, these are:

## 1 Introduction

[01_01_intro_hist_kde_qdot.R](01_01_intro_hist_kde_qdot.R)
 - Code for recreating the density plot, histogram, and quantile dot plot shown in the introduction.

## 2 Visual predictive checks for continuous data

Four notebooks creating the visualizations and goodness-of-fit tests for the samples from distributions with almost everywhere continuous density functions:
  - Smooth distribution: [02_01_continuous_smooth.qmd](02_01_continuous_smooth.qmd) 
  - Density with steps: [02_02_continuous_step.qmd](02_02_continuous_step.qmd)
  - Bounded distribution: [02_03_continuous_bounded.qmd](02_03_continuous_bounded.qmd)
  - Sampling distribution with a point mass: [02_04_continuous_point_mass.qmd](02_04_continuous_point_mass.qmd)
 
The overlaid predictive checks with kernel density plots, histograms, and quantile dot plots: [02_05_predictive_checking.qmd](02_05_predictive_checking.qmd).

## 3 Visual predictive checks for count data
The kernel density plots and rootograms in the third section are created and discussed in hte first half of the roaches notebook at [03_01_roaches.qmd](03_01_roaches.qmd).

## 4 Visual predictive checks for binary data
In the second half of the roaches notebook, we discuss the visualizations for binary outcomes in more detail: [03_01_roaches.qmd](03_01_roaches.qmd).

## 5 Visual predictive checks for categorical data
A case-study for the categorical example: [04_02_categorical.qmd](04_02_categorical.qmd).

## 6 Visual predictive checks for ordinal data
A case-study for the ordinal example: [04_03_ordinal.qmd](04_03_ordinal.qmd).
